          <h2 id="oscal-100-release">OSCAL 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2.</p>
<h3 id="overall-changes">Overall changes</h3>
<p>The following general changes were made in this release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In prior releases for some JSON objects, an object's identifier was used as a property.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&#34;identifer1&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&#34;comment&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&#34;remainder of object 1&#34;</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="nt">&#34;identifer2&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&#34;comment&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&#34;remainder of object 2&#34;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>While this &quot;BY_KEY&quot; notation does enforce uniqueness of identifiers, this syntax is difficult to write parsers for. This release removes the use of this syntax in favor of a simple array of objects. See issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/914">usnistgov/OSCAL#914</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In prior OSCAL releases, the data types used in the OSCAL XML and JSON schemas did not require that provided strings are non-empty (see issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805">usnistgov/OSCAL#805</a>), and leading and trailing whitespace was also allowed (see issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805">usnistgov/OSCAL#805</a>). Some XML parsers that are schema aware are capable of removing this extra whitespace based on the <code>whiteSpace=&quot;collapse&quot;</code> schema facet. This only works if the parser is schema aware. To normalize this behavior across all parsers, the OSCAL string data types will now not allow leading and trailing whitespace.</p>
<p>This led to updates to the string data types in XML and JSON. The <code>ncname</code> data type was also replaced by <code>token</code> (see issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/911">usnistgov/OSCAL#911</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-to-profile-model">Changes to Profile Model</h3>
<p>In /profile/modify/alter (<a href="../../reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter">XML</a>) the following changes were made. See issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/928">usnistgov/OSCAL#928</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The item remove (<a href="../../reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters/removes">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter/remove">XML</a>) has had its child properties/attributes renamed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>name-ref -&gt; by-name</li>
<li>class-ref -&gt; by-class</li>
<li>id-ref -&gt; by-id</li>
<li>item-name -&gt; by-item-name</li>
<li>ns-ref -&gt; by-ns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The item add (<a href="../../reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters/adds">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter/add">XML</a>) has had its child properties/attributes renamed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>id-ref -&gt; by-id</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-to-system-security-plan-model">Changes to System Security Plan Model</h3>
<p>In /system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement (<a href="../../reference/latest/system-security-plan/json-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirements">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/system-security-plan/xml-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement">XML</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>The item control-id (<a href="../../reference/latest/system-security-plan/json-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirements/control-id">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/system-security-plan/xml-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement/@control-id">XML</a>) is now required</li>
<li>In XML the ordering of elements has changed (i.e. responsible-role was moved in the sequence). This change was made to keep the XML element sequencing consistent between this model and the component definition model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-to-assessment-results-model">Changes to Assessment Results Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The item findings (<a href="../../reference/latest/assessment-results/json-reference/#/assessment-results/results/findings">JSON/YAML</a>, <a href="../../reference/latest/assessment-results/xml-reference/#/assessment-results/result/finding">XML</a>) is now optional. See issue <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/918">usnistgov/OSCAL#918</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oscal-100-release-candidate-2">OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate 2</h2>
<p>The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2 since OSCAL 1.0.0 RC 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplification of key OSCAL features
<ul>
<li>Properties and annotations have been merged into a single <code>prop</code> that now allows an optional <code>remarks</code> and <code>uuid</code>.</li>
<li>In the  assessment plan and assessment results models, the concepts of a <code>task</code> and <code>action</code> have been combined.</li>
<li>Use of <code>local-definitions</code> in the assessment plan, assessment results, and POA&amp;M models has been simplified and made more consistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model documentation improvements
<ul>
<li>Some usage descriptions were enhanced to provide more detail and to be more consistent overall.</li>
<li>Formal names were updated in some places where the names did not match the data element.</li>
<li>Many spelling errors were corrected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the use of XML <code>&lt;any&gt;</code> and JSON <code>additonalProperties</code> for arbitrary extensions based on community discussion. Extended data can still be provided using <code>link</code> declarations to external content. This decision can be revisited in future revisions once there is more implementation experience with the OSCAL models.</li>
<li>Added the following <code>link</code> relations: <code>latest-version</code>, <code>predecessor-version</code>, and <code>successor-version</code> to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.</li>
<li>Fixed a few bugs in the profile resolver code and updated the resolver to work with new profile import/insert structures.</li>
<li>Provided support for data insertion points for data other than parameters in markup content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-common-to-all-models">Changes common to all models</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;props&quot; and &quot;annotations&quot; in JSON, and &quot;prop&quot; and &quot;annotation&quot; in XML, have been merged into a single property that now allows an optional <code>remark</code> and <code>uuid</code>. Semantically, the optional <code>remark</code> and <code>uuid</code> were the only difference between a &quot;prop&quot; and an &quot;annotation&quot; in OSCAL. The resulting model is simpler with a single construct that will always allow a remark. Names and values that were allowed on annotations are now allowed on properties.</li>
<li><code>latest-version</code>, <code>predecessor-version</code>, and <code>successor-version</code> link relations were added to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.</li>
<li>Markup content may now contain data insertion points for data other than parameters. The <code>insert</code> object, which may appear in markup content strings, now supports a <code>type</code> which can be used to indicate the type of data to insert, and an <code>id-ref</code> that identifies the specific data object to take data from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="model-specific-changes">Model-Specific Changes</h3>
<h4 id="catalog-and-profile">Catalog and Profile</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remarks were added to <code>param</code> declarations.</li>
<li>The import/insert structure in OSCAL profiles has been updated to align with the include/exclude syntax used in the assessment models. This lays the groundwork for more dynamic extension and expansion of include/exclude capabilities in future releases.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="component-definition">Component Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>set-parameter</code> was added to <code>/component-definition/component(s)//control-implementations</code> to allow for parameter values to be more conveniently defined for all control implementations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assessment-plan-and-assessment-results">Assessment Plan and Assessment Results</h4>
<ul>
<li>The concepts of task and action were combined, resulting in only the concept of a task. A task now has a type, which defines if the task is a &quot;milestone&quot; or &quot;action&quot;. This resulted in the following changes:
<ul>
<li><code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/action(s)</code> was removed.</li>
<li><code>/assessment-results/results/assessment-log/entry/related-action(s)</code> was removed.</li>
<li>A task can now define a <code>dependency</code> on another task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In multiple locations <code>assessment-subject</code> has been renamed to <code>subject</code> to be more consistent. Before there was a mixture of names.</li>
<li>In JSON the <code>/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions//parts</code> is always an array. In RC1, if a single part object was provided, the value was a single object.</li>
<li>In JSON the <code>/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods</code> was renamed to &quot;objectives-and-methods&quot;. Similarly, in XML <code>/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods</code> was renamed to &quot;objectives-and-methods&quot;.</li>
<li>In JSON and XML <code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/assessment-assets</code> has been added to allow each result to declare which assessment assets were used during the assessment, if these assets differ from what was defined in the assessment plan. This construct was moved from <code>/assessment-results/results</code>.</li>
<li>In JSON and XML <code>/assessment-results/results/assessment-subject</code> has been removed. This was originally used to add subjects that were not found in the assessment plan or SSP. In <code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions</code> you can specify <code>component(s)</code>, <code>inventory-item(s)</code>, and <code>user(s)</code> definitions. These allow the identification of subjects that are not in the assessment plan or SSP, making <code>assessment-subject</code> unneeded.</li>
<li>In <code>/assessment-results/results/finding</code> the <code>collected</code> and <code>expires</code> was removed, since this is an aspect of the observation, not the finding.</li>
<li>In <code>/assessment-results/results/finding</code> the <code>objective-status</code> has been replaced by <code>finding-target</code> which can now be used to provide a status on a per-subject basis. This allows a finding to be associated with multiple related subjects that might have different states.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oscal-100-release-candidate-1">OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate 1</h2>
<p>The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 1 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 3.</p>
<p>Changes in this release have been focused on the following major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making naming in XML and JSON/YAML more consistent.</li>
<li>Ensuring that all data types and cardinalities are appropriate.</li>
<li>Refactoring to cleanup models, making them: 1) more consistent with the other OSCAL models, 2) making them more simple when possible, and 3) providing room for future addition of new features.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-common-to-all-models-1">Changes common to all models</h3>
<ul>
<li>many elements in XML, and properties in JSON and YAML, have been renamed to make the naming more consistent between elements names in XML and property names in JSON and YAML. Now JSON properties that contain an array of objects use a plural form of the XML element name. The one exception is &quot;prop&quot; in XML vs &quot;properties&quot; in JSON and YAML. This decision was made to make the XML use of &quot;prop&quot; more concise, since &quot;prop&quot; elements are used a good deal in OSCAL XML formats.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changes-to-all-xml-formats">Changes to all XML formats</h4>
<p>In {top-level-element}/metadata:</p>
<ul>
<li>renamed &quot;revision-history&quot; to &quot;revisions&quot;</li>
<li>renamed &quot;doc-id&quot; to &quot;document-id&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/document-id:</p>
<ul>
<li>renamed &quot;type&quot; to &quot;scheme&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/location/prop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined allowed values for the &quot;name&quot; attribute. Using the &quot;type&quot; as the name attribute value, you can now specify that a location is a &quot;data-center&quot; location and also use the &quot;class&quot; attribute to qualify the data center location as &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;alternate&quot;.</li>

<li>renamed &quot;phone&quot; to &quot;telephone-number&quot;</li>
<li>changed sequencing of where &quot;address&quot; appears</li>
<li>made use of address and location-uuid mutually exclusive, since either a static address or a reference to location provides similar functionality. The &quot;location-type&quot; attribute has been removed. This should data should now be described on the referenced &quot;location&quot; element using a prop element with a name of &quot;type&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/party/prop:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Changes to all &quot;prop&quot; elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the data type of &quot;ns&quot; to &quot;uri&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>Changes to all &quot;annotation&quot; elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the data type of &quot;ns&quot; to &quot;uri&quot;</li>
<li>renamed &quot;id&quot; to &quot;uuid&quot; and changed type to &quot;uuid&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>In {top-level-object}/metadata/parties:</p>

<h3 id="refactoring-of-the-assessment-and-assessment-result-layer-models">Refactoring of the assessment and assessment result layer models</h3>
<p>The assessment plan, assessment results, and plan of actions and milestones models have undergone some significant revisions. These revisions have been based on community feedback and a need to provide more extensibility for future growth. Extra review of these models is appreciated as we make preparations for the OSCAL 1.0.0 FINAL release.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-assessment-plan-model">Changes to the assessment plan model</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of changes in this model, the following documentation details how the new model roughly maps to the older 1.0.0-milestone3 model. The following changes have been made in the XML, JSON, and YAML formats for the OSCAL assessment plan model.</p>
<h4 id="changes-to-the-assessment-plan-xml-format">Changes to the assessment plan XML format</h4>
<p>/assessment-plan/local-definitions</p>
<ul>
<li>The structures located in /assessment-plan/assessment-subjects/local-definitions has been moved here. This includes the component, inventory-item, and user element constructions. This allows all content that augments the content from the referenced SSP to be located within a top-level element.</li>
<li>The &quot;add-objectives-and-methods&quot; element has been added which allow the definitions of new assessment objectives and methods which are to be used in the assessment, but are not located in the catalog for which the system's baseline is generated from. This replaces the original elements located in /assessment-plan/objectives/objective and /assessment-plan/objectives/method.</li>
<li>The &quot;activity&quot; element has been added to allow an assessment process to be defined. These assessment activities can then be referenced by a specific assessment-action.</li>
</ul>
<p>/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>This new element provides a means to include textual front matter in the assessment plan. This can be used to define rules of engagement, activities to include/exclude from assessments, instructions for delivering results, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>/assessment-plan/reviewed-controls</p>
<ul>

These include (in the SSP model) : 'location', 'party', 'resource', 'diagram', 'user', 'component', 'protocol', 'inventory-item', 'implemented-requirement', 'statement', and 'by-component'. In all models, it includes 'location', 'party', and 'resource'. Finally, the full assemblies 'catalog', 'profile' and 'system-security-plan' fall into this category.</p>
<p>Similarly, flags and fields that are named to indicate they provide a point of reference, are now renamed '-uuid' reflecting when their references is given specifically as a 'uuid' (and validated as such) not as an 'id'. These include 'location-uuid' and 'party-uuid'.</p>
<h4 id="metadata-changes">'metadata' changes</h4>
<p>Milestone 3 has two assemblies in the metadata, revision for tracking a revision history, and location, an abstraction (and alternative) to the older address modeling.</p>
<p>[M2] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)</p>
<p>[M3] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), revision* (assembly), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), location* (assembly), party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)</p>
<h5 id="new-revision-assembly-revision-history-entry-all-models">New 'revision' assembly: Revision History Entry (all models)</h5>
<p>Tracking revisions can now be done by capturing a snapshot of metadata at an earlier point, potentially with properties or remarks added to indicate revision status or purpose.</p>
<p>[M3] model: title? (field), published? (field), last-modified? (field), version? (field), oscal-version? (field), prop* (field), link* (field), remarks? (field)</p>
<h5 id="new-location-assembly-location-all-models">New 'location' assembly: Location (all models)</h5>
<p>A new assembly permits factoring out geographic or contact information (an address or contact point) into a separate data structure, for reference using its 'uuid' flag.</p>
<p>[M3] model: title? (field), address (assembly), email* (field), phone* (field), url* (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)</p>
<h5 id="new-location-uuid-location-reference">New 'location-uuid': Location Reference</h5>
<h5 id="party-changes-all-models">'party' changes (all models)</h5>
<p>'party' is for Party (organization or person). It has been refactored to reflect the (somewhat arbitrary) 'organization' vs 'person' distinction into a 'type' flag.</p>
<p>Where before, we had an 'id' flag, now we have 'uuid'. We also have 'type', a flag whose value can capture &quot;person&quot; or &quot;organization&quot;.</p>
<p>We also have new fields for linking to other assemblies, including 'member-of-organization'. Instead of 'org-name' and 'person-name' we simply have 'party-name'.</p>
<p>[M2] flags: id?</p>
<p>[M3] flags: uuid?, type?</p>
<p>[M2] model: person* (assembly), org? (assembly), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)</p>
<p>[M3] model: party-name (field), short-name? (field), external-id* (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), address* (assembly), email* (field), phone* (field), member-of-organization (field), location-uuid (field)**, remarks? (field)</p>

<h5 id="new-field-party-name-party-name">New field 'party-name': Party Name</h5>
<p>Replaces 'org-name' and 'person-name' from the M2 model.</p>
<h4 id="back-matter-changes">'back-matter' changes</h4>
<p>In the back matter, the old 'citation' element has been refactored as a special case of 'resource'.</p>
<p>[M2] model: citation* (assembly), resource* (assembly)</p>

<h2 id="oscal-100-milestone-2">OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 2</h2>
<h3 id="new-oscal-features">New OSCAL Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>A System Security Plan (SSP) model has been added to OSCAL for use by organizations to document the implementation of security and privacy controls in an information system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>The following content model changes have been made to the catalog and profile models that may break content compatibility:</p>
<h4 id="document-metadata">Document metadata</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>last-modified</code> is now required. Its value must be a date-time with time zone (i.e., a timestamp). The old element <code>last-modified-date</code> is no longer permitted.</li>
<li><code>published</code> is permitted for a nominal publication date, as assigned by the owner or publisher of the catalog or resource. An electronic version of a previously published catalog should carry its own publication date, if any, not that of the original resource (which can be described elsewhere with its own metadata).</li>
<li><code>role-id</code> is now assigned as an element in the XML, not an attribute. This permits it to be tokenized more explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="control-structures-in-the-catalog-model">Control structures in the catalog model</h4>
<h5 id="new-property-in-sp800-53-catalog-data">New property in SP800-53 catalog data</h5>
<p>In the SP800-53 catalog, we have added a property called <code>sort-id</code> to controls and enhancements. Its string value represents the control's ID in a (zero-padded) notation that will sort gracefully against other <code>sort-id</code> values. This permits a robust reordering of controls in receiving systems without having to refer to an out-of-line document to restore the canonical order.</p>
<h5 id="controls-inside-controls-but-no-subcontrols">Controls inside controls, but no &quot;subcontrols&quot;</h5>
<p>Control enhancements are now represented using <code>control</code> not <code>subcontrol</code>. The advantages of restricting to two levels of hierarchy (even given groups and parts) became too few in view of the sacrifices to expressiveness so we have gone back to clean recursion.</p>
<h4 id="data-type-handling">Data type handling</h4>
<p>Data type handling has been extended in several respects to provide for the validating of lexical forms of nominal datatypes. Datatypes for dates and times have been added. Several XML-peculiar datatypes have been removed.</p>
<h5 id="value-enumeration-on-terminal-nodes">Value enumeration on terminal nodes</h5>
<p>The schema has also been extended to support validation against enumerated values, either exclusively (only declared values may appear) or inclusively (enumerations are documented while other values are also permitted). All allowed values now being declared (Milestone 2) are inclusive of other values (user- or application-defined), so this is not a breaking change.</p>
<p>Affected data points (in both models): <code>prop/name</code>, <code>address/type</code>, <code>phone/type</code>, <code>hash/algorithm</code>, <code>role-id</code>. The enumerated values provided for each are documented.</p>
<h5 id="lexical-datatyping-at-points">Lexical datatyping at points</h5>
<p>Supported for lexical datatyping has also been added to <code>link/href</code>, <code>rlink/href</code> (URI references), <code>published</code> and <code>last-modified</code> (timestamps), <code>email</code> (a nominal email address), <code>url</code> (a URI), <code>img/src</code>.</p>
<h4 id="profile-model-enhancements">Profile model enhancements</h4>
<h5 id="calling-control-enhancements-old-subcontrols">Calling control enhancements (old &quot;subcontrols&quot;)</h5>
<p>From call statements, since <code>subcontrol</code> has been dropped from the catalog model, <code>subcontrol-id</code> has been replaced with <code>control-id</code>, and <code>with-subcontrols</code> has been replaced by <code>with-child-controls</code> (on <code>call</code>, <code>all</code> and <code>match</code>). Essentially, a subcontrol is now represented as a control that is a child another parent control.</p>
<h5 id="expanded-model-for-new-groups">Expanded model for new groups</h5>
<p>Elements besides control references are now permitted inside <code>group</code> within the <code>merge</code> construct, so profile authors can provide titles and introductory content to groups they define for their represented aggregate control structures.</p>
<h5 id="parameter-settings">Parameter settings</h5>
<p>Added 'guideline' to profile model. It was omitted in error.</p>
<p>See issues #494, #288 (adding 'guideline' to profile model)</p>
<h2 id="oscal-100-milestone-1">OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 1</h2>
